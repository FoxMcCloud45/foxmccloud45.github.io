### *The Orange Box*

This website is an archived version of the promotional website for 
*The Orange Box* by Valve Software from 2009.

### Ruffle player

`flash.xht` is a lame Ruffle player for Flash content using external 
URL addresses. Since most websites have CORS policies preventing 
access to such files externally, it's pretty useless.

[Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/) works though.
